# Milk e-store practice backend
This is a practice at setting up an ASP NET Core API which interacts with a MongoDB database on the Mongo Atlas cloud. 
The partnered front-end is the https://github.com/nHellstrom/milk-estore project. 

While it's not very RESTful in terms of available endpoints, this was intended as a customer facing API, and database manipulation is inteded through the Atlas cloud service.

## How to run
Requirements: ASP Net Core 7 SDK

Start API with "dotnet run"
